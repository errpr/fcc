# Blank application template

For my react apps made locally but intended to be pasted into a codepen after development.

## How to use

1. Copy into blank folder
- Change app name in `package.json`
- Change description, author, and title in `src/index.html`
- Run `ruby build_watcher.rb` and start development!
