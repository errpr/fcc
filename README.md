These are projects I've completed from freeCodeCamp's online course.

## Please Note

The front-end & data-viz projects are all written intended be uploaded to [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) (with the exception of twitch_checker.)

This means all the javascript must be placed in a single file. This is not typically best practice.
